<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a car dealership website called Choose Me Auto. The application should feature a FastAPI backend that loads vehicle inventory from a CSV file and a React frontend for displaying vehicles and capturing customer leads. Key requirements include a search/results page, a detailed vehicle page, lead capture forms, and a system to scrape and locally store vehicle photos. Subsequent requests expanded this to include Mailchimp integration, bilingual (Spanish) support, and a more robust photo scraping mechanism.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Backend (FastAPI):**
    *   Load vehicle inventory from a CSV file.
    *   API endpoints for listing/filtering vehicles () and retrieving single vehicles ().
    *   API endpoint for lead capture () with Mailchimp integration.
2.  **Frontend (React):**
    *   A professional homepage with a hero section.
    *   A Search Results Page () with filtering, including a pre-filtered view for .
    *   A Vehicle Detail Page () with an image gallery and lead form.
    *   Functional forms for , , and .
    *   A Thank You page for post-submission flow.
    *   Bilingual (English/Spanish) text on key pages.
3.  **Vehicle Photo System:**
    *   A robust script (using Playwright) to scrape multiple, high-quality photos from vehicle detail pages.
    *   Store images locally in .
    *   Enrich the inventory CSV with local image paths for the backend and frontend to use.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A feature-complete full-stack application (React/FastAPI) has been built.
- **Backend**: Loads 113 vehicles from a CSV on startup. All vehicle and lead APIs are functional. The lead capture endpoint is integrated with Mailchimp, awaiting user credentials.
- **Frontend**: A fully styled website with a professional homepage, vehicle search and detail pages, and a complete navigation system. The  route correctly filters for used cars.
- **Forms**: The Pre-Approval, Test Drive, and Contact pages are now fully functional forms that submit data to the backend. A Thank You page exists for post-submission redirection.
- **Bilingual Support**: Key pages (Homepage, Pre-Approval) and form labels now display bilingual (English/Spanish) text.
- **Photo Scraper**: An advanced Playwright-based scraper () has been created and tested to solve the issue of low-quality images from the original scraper. The user has been given detailed instructions on how to run this long-running task.
- **Vehicle Management**: The user has been instructed on how to manually manage inventory by editing the main CSV file, and the agent demonstrated this by adding a new vehicle.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: Demonstrating how to manually add a new vehicle by editing the inventory CSV file (). The agent successfully added a 2023 Honda Accord, restarted the backend, and verified via an API call that the vehicle count increased from 112 to 113.
-   **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
-   **Agent Testing Done**: Y
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: screenshot tool
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no known bugs or blocking issues.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1**: Verify the newly added vehicle on the frontend (P0)
    -   **Where to resume**: Take a screenshot of the  or  page to visually confirm that the newly added 2023 Honda Accord is displayed in the list.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: This will complete the user's request for a demonstration on how to manually manage the vehicle inventory.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
    -   **Blocked on something**: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    -   **P0**: Run the Playwright photo scraper () to replace the current low-quality/stock vehicle images with multiple, high-quality images. This is a long-running task that the user/ops team will execute based on the provided guide.
    -   **P1**: Add Bad Credit OK / No Credit OK badges to the navigation bar for marketing emphasis.
-   **Future Tasks**:
    -   **P1**: Implement a full database-backed system for leads using MongoDB to replace the current in-memory storage.
    -   **P2**: Build a full Admin Panel with a secure login system for managing vehicles (add/edit/delete/image upload) and viewing leads, as was discussed with the user.
    -   **P2**: Refactor the bilingual support from on-page text to a proper internationalization (i18n) framework with a language toggle (EN/ES).
    -   **P2**: Implement email/SMS notifications for new leads, in addition to the Mailchimp integration.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Homepage Hero Section (DONE)**: Implemented a new, professional hero section for the homepage.
-   **Used Vehicle Filtering (DONE)**: The  navigation link now correctly filters the inventory to show only used vehicles.
-   **Functional Lead-Capture Forms (DONE)**: Implemented functional, styled forms for the Pre-Approval, Test-Drive, and Contact pages, replacing the previous placeholders.
-   **Mailchimp Integration (Backend Ready) (DONE)**: The lead capture API now includes logic to push lead data to a Mailchimp audience. It requires user-provided API keys to be fully active.
-   **Thank You Page (DONE)**: Created a  page to improve the user journey after a form submission.
-   **Advanced Photo Scraper (Playwright) (DONE)**: Developed and provided a new, robust Playwright-based script () to download multiple high-quality images per vehicle, solving issues with the previous basic scraper.
-   **Bilingual Support (Phase 1) (DONE)**: Added Spanish text alongside English on the homepage and key forms to provide immediate bilingual support.
-   **CSV Vehicle Management Guide (DONE)**: Clarified that there is no admin panel and demonstrated how to add new vehicles by manually editing the CSV file. Successfully added one new vehicle.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. The issue of low-quality images was addressed by creating the new Playwright scraper. The execution of the scraper is now a task for the user/ops team.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic, In-memory data store (from CSV).
-   **Frontend**: React (Create React App), .
-   **Data Scraping**: Python with , , and  for advanced, JS-aware scraping.

**key DB schema**
No database is currently in use. Data is loaded from a CSV into Pydantic models.

**changes in tech stack**
-    was added as a Python dependency for the advanced photo scraper.

**All files of reference**
-   : The single source of truth for vehicle inventory. Was recently updated to add one more vehicle.
-   : The new, powerful script to fetch high-quality vehicle images.
-   : Contains the logic for capturing leads from all forms and pushing them to Mailchimp.
-   : Updated with bilingual text.
-   : Updated with bilingual text.
-   : A guide created for the user on how to manage inventory via CSV.

**Areas that need refactoring**
-   The current bilingual support (hardcoded English and Spanish text on pages) should be refactored into a proper i18n library for better scalability and maintenance.
-   The lead storage is still in-memory and should be migrated to a persistent database like MongoDB.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Returns list of all vehicles. Supports  filter.
-   : Returns details for a single vehicle.
-   : Submits a new lead from any of the three forms; includes Mailchimp integration logic.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The application is functionally complete according to the user's requests. The main remaining tasks are enhancements.
-   **Vehicle management is done by manually editing a CSV file.** The user is aware of this and chose this method over an admin panel for now. Your immediate next step is to show the user the vehicle you just added on the frontend.
-   **A powerful Playwright photo scraper has been created.** Do not try to re-invent this. The user has been instructed on how to run this long-running task to fix the low-quality images.
-   **Mailchimp integration is coded but not active.** It requires the user to add their API keys to the  file. Do not ask for these keys. The user has a guide on how to test it once they add them.
